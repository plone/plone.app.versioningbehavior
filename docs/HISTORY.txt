Changelog
=========


1.0b3 (2011-03-01)
------------------

* Remove grok usage, tidy up and declare zope.app.container dependency.
  [elro]

  [elro]

1.0b2 (2011-01-25)
------------------

* Changed the behavior so that the changeNote field is only
  rendered in the Add and Edit forms.
  [deo]

* Made sure to always try to catch the ArchivistUnregisteredError
  exception at create_version_on_save (this mimics the original
  handling from CMFEditions).
  [deo]


1.0b1 (2010-11-04)
------------------

* Renamed package to `plone.app.versioningbehavior`.
  [jbaumann]

* Load Products.CMFEditions before testing.
  [jbaumann]

* Added some more tests.
  [jbaumann]

* Renamed package to plone.versioningbehavior (see dexterity mailing list).
  [jbaumann]

* Re-enabled IObjectAddedEvent-Eventhandler. The pickling error was fixed in
  CMFEdition's trunk.
  [jbaumann]

* Renamed the behavior marker interface IVersionOnSave to IVersioningSupport
  because it depends on the "version" settings in the types control panel if
  a content is automatically versioning on saving or not. The marker interface
  should only indicate if the type could be versioned or not.
  [jbaumann]

* Added locales directory with own domain for local translations.
  [jbaumann]

* Updated README.txt, included doctests in long-description.
  [jbaumann]

* Updated tests: events and version creation are now tested properly.
  [jbaumann]

* Added helper method for getting the changenote from the request annotation.
  [jbaumann]

* Storing changenote in an annotation on the request between the field-adapter
  and the event handler which creates the version. That makes it possible to
  use different form and widget manager prefixes.
  [jbaumann]

* Added localization for the comment field.
  [jbaumann]

* Disabled the Added-Event because it's not working due to a pickling problem.
  [jbaumann]

* Added a form-field changeNote. It's content is used as comment for the
  created version.
  [jbaumann]

* Added a Event-Handler for creating a new version on save.
  [jbaumann]

* Implemented the behavior plone.behaviors.versioning.behaviors.IVersionable.
