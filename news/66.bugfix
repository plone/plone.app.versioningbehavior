Improve performance of the CloneNamedFileBlobs modifier
which is used to handle Dexterity NamedBlobFile and NamedBlobImage fields
while creating and retrieving versions. Previously the contents of the Blob
were copied to a new Blob, but that is unnecessary and slow. Now the modifier
simply ensures that the version retains a reference to the existing Blob.
This also reduces use of data storage since only one copy of the Blob is needed
rather than two.
