.. towncrier release notes start

2.0.1 (2023-03-22)
------------------

Internal:


- Update configuration files.
  [plone devs] (b2d5d4a5)


2.0.0 (2022-11-30)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Final release.
  [gforcada] (#600)


2.0.0b1 (2022-07-21)
--------------------

Bug fixes:


- Fix test for changed label in `Products.CMFEditions`.
  [petschki] (#64)
- Improve performance of the CloneNamedFileBlobs modifier
  which is used to handle Dexterity NamedBlobFile and NamedBlobImage fields
  while creating and retrieving versions. Previously the contents of the Blob
  were copied to a new Blob, but that is unnecessary and slow. Now the modifier
  simply ensures that the version retains a reference to the existing Blob.
  This also reduces use of data storage since only one copy of the Blob is needed
  rather than two.
  [davisagli] (#66)

1.0b7 (2011-10-03)
------------------

* Fixed a bug in the CloneNamedFileBlobs modifier causing an AttributeError
  when the previous version doesn't have a blob and the working copy has one.
  [buchi]


1.0b6 (2011-09-25)
------------------

* Add missing dependency declaration on plone.namedfile[blobs].
  [davisagli]


1.0b5 (2011-09-01)

* Fixed setuphandler to not fail with older versions of Products.CMFEditions
  that do not have a Skip_z3c_blobfile modifier.

  [deo]

------------------

* Renamed package to `plone.app.versioningbehavior`.
  [jbaumann]

  [jbaumann]

* Added some more tests.
  [jbaumann]

* Renamed package to plone.versioningbehavior (see dexterity mailing list).

* Re-enabled IObjectAddedEvent-Eventhandler. The pickling error was fixed in
  CMFEdition's trunk.
  [jbaumann]

* Renamed the behavior marker interface IVersionOnSave to IVersioningSupport
  because it depends on the "version" settings in the types control panel if
  a content is automatically versioning on saving or not. The marker interface
  should only indicate if the type could be versioned or not.
  [jbaumann]

* Added locales directory with own domain for local translations.
  [jbaumann]

* Updated README.txt, included doctests in long-description.
  [jbaumann]

  [jbaumann]

* Added helper method for getting the changenote from the request annotation.
  [jbaumann]

* Storing changenote in an annotation on the request between the field-adapter
  and the event handler which creates the version. That makes it possible to
  use different form and widget manager prefixes.
  [jbaumann]

* Added localization for the comment field.
  [jbaumann]

* Disabled the Added-Event because it's not working due to a pickling problem.
  [jbaumann]

* Added a form-field changeNote. It's content is used as comment for the
  created version.
  [jbaumann]

* Added a Event-Handler for creating a new version on save.
  [jbaumann]

* Implemented the behavior plone.behaviors.versioning.behaviors.IVersionable.
  [jbaumann]
